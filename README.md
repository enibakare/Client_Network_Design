# LAN Design for Advertising Client

## Description
Designed and implemented a scalable Local Area Network (LAN) for an advertising client with 50 employees across two floors, integrating wired and wireless solutions.

## Objectives
- Identify and implement a LAN as the appropriate network type.
- List and integrate necessary network elements.
- Build the network incrementally for effective troubleshooting.

## Key Features
- **IP Addressing**: Used CIDR (e.g., `192.168.10.1/26`) for efficient and scalable IP allocation.
- **DHCP**: Configured automatic IP assignment with four DHCP pools.
- **RIP v2**: Enabled routing between networks for seamless communication.
- **Security**: Implemented passwords and SSH for secure access.

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Protocols: DHCP, RIP v2, SSH

## Configuration Highlights
- Router configuration with DHCP and RIP (Floor 1).
- Wireless access point setup for Office A.
